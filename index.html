				<b>City pop (シティ・ポップ, shitī poppu)</b> is a loose category of Japanese pop music that emerged
				in the late 1970s and peaked in the 1980s. It was originally termed as an offshoot of Japan's
				Western-influenced "new music", but came to include a wide range of styles associated with the
				country's leisure class and nascent economic boom, such as AOR, soft rock, R&B, funk, and boogie.
				It was also identified with new technologies such as the Walkman, cars with built-in cassette decks
				and FM stereos, and various electronic musical instruments.

				There's so many City Pop artits that were populer in the early 80s. Few notable ones are Tatsuro Yamashita,
				Toshiki Kadomatsu, Mariya Takeuchi, Miki Matsubara, etc. But in the early 90s, City Pop genre was overtaken by J-pop and J-rock.<br>
				And then around mid-2010s, City pop experiencing a resurrection thanks to Vaporwave and video-sharing websites like YouTube. And now,
				City Pop has a massive community in Japan and also overseas countries such as USA, UK, Australia, etc.
